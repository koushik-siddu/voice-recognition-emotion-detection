# Automated Music Playing System Using Emotion Detection

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered music player that detects emotions from voice inputs and plays music based on the user's mood. It integrates **voice recognition, speech emotion analysis, and machine learning** to classify emotions in real-time and generate mood-based playlists.

## Features
- **Emotion Detection:** Uses voice recognition and machine learning to analyze speech emotions.
- **Mood-Based Playlist Generation:** Selects music that matches the detected emotion.
- **Real-Time Emotion Classification:** Implements speech-to-text processing for live emotion analysis.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Leverages AI techniques to enhance accuracy and adaptability.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning (ML)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Speech Recognition
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (for model training)
- OpenCV (if facial expressions are also considered)
- Librosa (for audio processing)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Automated-Music-Emotion-Detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Automated-Music-Emotion-Detection
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the project:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
- Run the script to start the voice-based emotion detection system.
- Speak into the microphone, and the system will analyze your mood.
- The corresponding playlist will be played automatically based on detected emotions.
